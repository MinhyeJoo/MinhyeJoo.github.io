              <b>Abstract:</b> How do immigrants develop their attitudes toward
              the new country? What leads them to engage in politics in the host
              country? In my dissertation project, I argue that interactions
              with the new political system provide one path for immigrants to
              learn how the new system works and how the government perceives
              and treats them, which may affect the development of political
              attitudes toward the new country. With a focus on immigrants’
              contact with street-level bureaucrats, I argue that positive
              interactions with street-level bureaucrats lead immigrants to
              perceive their host country as responsive and trustworthy, which
              encourages them to engage in politics in the host country. On the
              other hand, I expect negative interactions with street-level
              bureaucrats to give the impression that the host country is
              unwelcoming and hostile, which discourages political activities in
              the host country. Drawing on data from a series of interviews and
              an original survey of immigrants and nonimmigrants with two
              embedded experiments, the study explores four questions: (1) how
              immigrants evaluate their bureaucratic experiences, (2) what
              comprises positive or negative bureaucratic interactions for
              immigrants, (3) whether bureaucratic interactions affect immigrant
              political attitudes and incorporation into the host country, and
              (4) what aspects of positive and negative interactions shape
              immigrants’ political attitudes and behaviors. The results
              highlight the role of bureaucratic encounters in the development
              of political attitudes and the decision to engage in politics in
              the host country among immigrants. This study demonstrates that
              immigrants have unique experiences with street-level bureaucrats
              that are distinguished from those of native-born nonimmigrants,
              and their encounters shape how they view the host country and
              whether they are successfully incorporated into the new society.
